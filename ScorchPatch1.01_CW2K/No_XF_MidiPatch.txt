Hello I am a marker file for Scorch Patch_CW2K.exe .

If I'm in the same dir as the patcher, the patcher will also do the XF_MidiExport::HtmlParams__SCORCH_SHOW_XF=1 patch.
^-Well that patch REPLACES the "Print"-button  with the "XF"-button to export the file to *.mid.

Printing is now only available via the right click popup context menu 'Print'.
(Sorry for that inconvenience, that's however some design bug/intent due to
object orientated
class
'cw2k' don't know how to overcome by patching)
Suggestion: to 'disable' me you maybe rename me to 
"Do_XF_MidiPatch.txt" ->  "No_XF_MidiPatch.txt"
